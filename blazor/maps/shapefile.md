# Shapefile in Blazor Maps Component

Shapefile is a popular geospatial vector data format for storing location-based information such as shapes, spatial locations, and pertinent properties of geographic landmarks.

## Adding shapefile

Shapefile can be used to render vector shape maps in the Maps component by specifying the remotely hosted file path of the shapefile in the [MapsLayer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Maps.MapsLayer-1.html)'s [ShapeData](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Maps.MapsLayer-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Maps_MapsLayer_1_ShapeData) property.

> Only when the shapefile is hosted on a remote server it will be displayed in the Maps component.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Maps

<div class="control-section">
    <SfMaps>
        <MapsAreaSettings Background="transparent" />
        <MapsLayers>
            <MapsLayer ShapeData='new {dataOptions = "https://cdn.syncfusion.com/maps/map-data/usa-states.shp"}' TValue="string">
                <MapsMarkerClusterSettings AllowClustering="true" AllowClusterExpand="true" Shape="MarkerType.Circle" Height="40" Width="40">
                    <MapsLayerMarkerClusterLabelStyle Color="#FFFFFF" />
                    <MapsLayerMarkerClusterConnectorLineSettings Color="#000000" />
                </MapsMarkerClusterSettings>
                <MapsMarkerSettings>

## Multilayer

The shapefile can also be rendered in multilayer structure as explained in [this section](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/maps/layers#multilayer) for GeoJSON map. Shapefiles can be added as multilayers in the ways listed below.

1. On top of the online map providers, the shapefile can be shown as a sublayer.
2. The shapefile can be shown as a sublayer above the GeoJSON map.
3. The GeoJSON map can be displayed as a sublayer over the shapefile map.
4. Shapefiles can be provided as both main and sublayer layers.

The following example demonstrates how to display the shapefile as a sublayer above the GeoJSON map.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Maps;

<SfMaps>
    <MapsLayers>
        <MapsLayer ShapeData='new {dataOptions= "https://cdn.syncfusion.com/maps/map-data/world-map.json"}' TValue="string">
        </MapsLayer>
        <MapsLayer ShapeData='new {dataOptions = "https://cdn.syncfusion.com/maps/map-data/usa-states.shp"}'
                   Type="Syncfusion.Blazor.Maps.Type.SubLayer" TValue="string">
            <MapsShapeSettings Fill="blue"></MapsShapeSettings>
        </MapsLayer>
    </MapsLayers>
</SfMaps>

```
