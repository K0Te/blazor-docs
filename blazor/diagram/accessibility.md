# Accessibility in Blazor Diagram Component

Accessibility is achieved in the diagram component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigation support. The diagram features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

The accessibility compliance for the diagram component is outlined below.

* [Color Contrast](../common/accessibility#color-contrast)
* [Mobile Device Support](../common/accessibility#mobile-device-support)
* [Keyboard Navigation Support](../common/accessibility#keyboard-navigation-support)
* [Axe-core Accessibility Validation](../common/accessibility#ensuring-accessibility)

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with HTML, JavaScript,and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the diagram component:

* aria-label (attribute)
