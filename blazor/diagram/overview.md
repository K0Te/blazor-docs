 The Blazor Diagram component is a fast and powerful library for visualizing, creating, and editing interactive diagrams. It supports creating flowcharts, organizational charts, mind maps, and more.

## Key features of SfDiagram are as follows:

* Flowchart: The Blazor Diagram component provides all the standard flowchart shapes as ready-made objects, making it is easy to add them to a diagram surface in a single call.
* Built-in Shapes: Provided built-in shapes such as basic and flow shapes.
* Interaction: Diagram elements can be selected, rotated, resized, and moved.
* Z-Order: Diagram elements overlapping can be controlled by changing their Z-Order value.
* Pan and Zoom: Allows you to pan, zoom in or out of your current diagram.
* Snapping: Precisely align nodes, connectors, and annotations while dragging them just by snapping to the nearest gridlines or objects.
* Undo/Redo: Allows you to keep track of the recent changes made in a SfDiagramComponent to correct your mistakes.
* Commands: Frequently used commands like delete, connect, and duplicate can be shown as buttons near a selector. This makes it easy for users to quickly perform those operations instead of searching for the correct buttons in a toolbox.
* Keyboard Shortcuts: Allows you to trigger the diagramming features using keyboard shortcuts.
* Clipboard Operations: Ability to cut, copy, and paste or duplicate selected Diagram elements within and across diagrams.
* Automatic Layouts: Built-in automatic nodes arrangement support for organization chart layout, mind map layout, hierarchical tree layout, and complex hierarchical layout.
* Serialization: Save the Blazor diagram state in JSON format and load it back later for further editing using the serializer.
* Symbol palette: Includes a gallery of stencils, reusable symbols, and nodes that can be dragged onto the surface of a Blazor diagram.
* Overview control: Displays a small preview of the full diagram page, which allows you to improve the navigation.
* Localization: Localizes every static text in the control to any supported language.
* DrawingTool: Draw all kinds of built-in nodes and connect them with connectors interactively by just clicking and dragging on the drawing area.
* Printing: Print diagrams from the browser. Users can also customize the page size, orientation, and page margin, and fit a diagram to a single page.
* Exporting: You can export a diagram to different image files such as PNG, JPEG, and SVG.
* Tooltip: Use tooltips to provide additional information about a node.
* Context menu: Easily map frequently used commands to the context menu.
