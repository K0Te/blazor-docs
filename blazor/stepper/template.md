# Customizing Stepper steps with templates

You can personalize the appearance of Stepper steps by using the [Template](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.SfStepper.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_SfStepper_Template) property. It enables the customization feature for different progress states within the stepper, encompassing indicators and the progress bar.

Below are examples demonstrating the customization of Stepper steps using the template support:

## Icon only

Customize the stepper step with only an icon for a minimalist visual representation.

## Icon with label

The stepper step combines the icon with a label, providing additional context and information.

## Icon with text

It incorporates both the icon and text, creating a visual representation with textual details.
