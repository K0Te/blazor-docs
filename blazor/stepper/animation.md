You can use the [StepperAnimationSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.StepperAnimationSettings.html) tag directive in the Stepper setting the `Enable` property to `true`. By default, it is `true`.

## Enabling animation

By using, the [Enable](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.StepperAnimationSettings.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_StepperAnimationSettings_Enable) property to activate/deactivate an animation. The default value is true, indicating that animation is enabled.

## Duration

The [Duration](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.StepperAnimationSettings.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_StepperAnimationSettings_Duration) property specifies the duration of the animation. The default value is set to `1000` milliseconds.

## Delay
